# Detecting Textual Saliency in Privacy Policy
### DS5500 Capstone Project

## Summary 

Websites, mobile apps, and other product and service providers share how they gather, use and manage customers' data in the form of privacy policy documents. However, due to their lengthy and complex nature, a majority of people tend to ignore these documents. To counteract the risks posed by this ignorance, we aim to develop language models to extract and deliver salient policy information to end-users. To that end, we propose two use case-specific modules, namely the INFORM module and the QUERY module, that collectively enable users to understand their rights better. 


The primary objective of the INFORM module lies in communicating key insights by exploiting a dataset containing 115 privacy policies defined by US companies. Additionally, we seek to build a selection of models that can annotate pre-defined categories to privacy policy paragraphs using supervised machine learning. The QUERY module can enable users to ask policy-related questions using a freeform question-answering system for privacy policies.  By retrieving the most relevant information from the policy document given a question, this system alleviates the burden of searching the target information from a lengthy policy document. To this purpose, we make use of a Question-Answer dataset that provides 714 human-annotated questions written for a wide range of privacy practices. Finally, we attempt to build on earlier studies in the literature and make the functionality publicly available using an interactive web framework.
